# Sound classification with CNN   

I used the CNN model to classify sounds based on Urban Sound Dataset. 
You can see two notebooks in the repo. 
The first notebook contains preprocessing of sound files(for ex: creating spectrograms, reading and preprocessing the spectrograms, etc.). 
The second notebook covers the building model.

Urban Sound dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes:
air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music.
